Summarization:

5 bullets: Produce up to five factual bullets derived strictly from text.

Key values: Preserve numeric results and units.

Claims discipline: Use cautious language when evidence is limited.

Validation:

Content-only derivation: Confirm each bullet maps to specific sentences/phrases in the section.

Length checks: Flag if fewer than five valid bullets are possible.

Artifacts:

Section summary unit: Store bullets, key values, and flags for rendering.
